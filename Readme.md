#data-view-projection

As enterprise apps grow in complexity, so does the relationships between the entities. When retrieving tons of data that have complex relationships and deep navigation properties, the process will take a toll n performance and UI responsiveness. This is where Crosslight View Projection comes in. With the View Projection technique, no matter how complex your object and relationship is, you can rest assured that data query is done very quickly and your data will display in seconds.

#Running the Sample

This sample is NuGet-enabled. For more information on restoring NuGet packages, check out this document: [Introduction to Crosslight NuGet Packages](http://developer.intersoftsolutions.com/display/crosslight/Introduction+to+Crosslight+NuGet+Packages#IntroductiontoCrosslightNuGetPackages-RestoringCrosslightPackages). By default, this project automatically points to a WebAPI server hosted in Intersoft's server. You can easily change this URL to your local development machine by running the WebAPI project on a separate instance of Visual Studio then exposing the IISExpress IP address to the local network. For more information, check out this document: [Configuring WebAPI-enabled Crosslight Samples](http://developer.intersoftsolutions.com/display/crosslight/Configuring+WebAPI-enabled+Crosslight+Samples).
